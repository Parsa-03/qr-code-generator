# QR Code Generator (represented by APAberg)

Here's the app you can use to recieve the QR code of your desired website for free.

To do this: 

1- First you should go through the desired folder you want the project to be deployed using "ls" for listing the folders and "cd" for opening it (or you can right-click on the folder if you have git installed, and open git bash there and there use "code ." command and hit enter.)

2- While in the right directory, use this command in the terminal: "git init"

3- Then this: "git clone https://github.com/Parsa-03/qr-code-generator.git"

4-  After cloning the repository succussfully, you can use "cd qr-code-generator" to go to its directory and in the terminal, use "npm install" or "yarn install" to install all required dependencies.

5- Finally, use "node .\index.js" to run the code. You'll see a prompt in terminal which asks for the website's link. input the link and receive the png QR code in the same directory with the name of the website url.
